//Binary Tree

1.Hierarchical data structure
2.Dynamic memory allocation
3.Sequential Access
4.Traversing start from root node

Main applications of trees include:
1. Manipulate hierarchical data.(File structure in OS)
2. Make information easy to search
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
 

A Tree node contains following parts.
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child

Types:
1.Full Binary Tree :A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children
2.Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level 
3.Perfect Binary Tree :A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
4.Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
5.A degenerate (or pathological) tree: A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.
