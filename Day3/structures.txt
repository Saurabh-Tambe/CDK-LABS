Comparison Of Data Structures:
1.Array
->Sequential Access
->stored at contiguous memory locations
->Static Allocation
->Use for limited data
->Array contains elements of same data type


2.Linked List
->Sequential Access
->Dynamic Memory Allocation
->A linked list is a linear data structure


3.Stack
->Linear Data Structure
->stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
->Dynamic Memory Allocation
->The stack can contain elements of the different data types.
->Stack has only one end open for pushing and popping the data 


4.Queue
->Queues are based on the FIFO principle,
->Dynamic Memory Allocation
->The queue can contain elements of the different data types.
-> Queue has both ends open for enqueuing and dequeuing the data
